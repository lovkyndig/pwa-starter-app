# GitHub and Vercel
We need to push our local repo to github and then connect it to vercel. Than we have our app published on vercel. If the name you have set for your repo is [my-google-app](https://my-google-app.vercel.app){:target="_blank"}, then you will find your app on internet with that url (if you don't change it manually on vercel): 
- "https://my-google-app.vercel.app"
 
## GitHub
If your username on github is `super-user`, than I can find you on this url: 
- "https://github.com/super-user"

If you create a repo with name `my-first-repo`, than the url to this repo will be: 
- "https://github.com/super-user/my-first-repo"

## Vercel
The repo-name on vercel well be a subdomene of vercel, like this:
- "my-first-repo.vercel.app"

If I want my repo to be published on vercel, I normally check if the subdomene isn't used by anyone else. This is how I check it out:

### Check if a subdomene isn't busy
Write the url you want to have (in the browsers url-field):
- https://iwantthisurl.vercel.app

If this name isn't busy and used by anyone, you will get a 404-error, like the one in the following picture.
![Error 404: The url dosn't exist! Take it if you want it:)](./404-not-found.webp "Error 404: The url dosn't exist! Take it if you want it:)"){.border-solid .border-4}

### Connect Vercel to GitHub
Read about how to connect Vercel to your GitHub [here](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/git/vercel-for-github){:target="_blank"}.

Normally when you connect your github account to vercel, all pushes to github will be published on vercel as default, as described [here](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/git/vercel-for-github){:target="_blank"}.
