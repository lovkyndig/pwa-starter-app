::::TabItem{name="Why?"}
I'm using it as a starter kit, because I want the same theme in all my apps, and fokus on the content when I'm writing content.

Maybe the most important thing is that the content on my pages is heavy (and serious) - and its about words, not pictures or videos. 

When it takes about on hour to read only one article, you need the futrues in this repo with search-functionalities and collapseble accordions, and a amazing catalog with overview of the content.[^1]

::::TabItem{name="Content"}
All the _articles_ in the _content_-folder is a copy of the content in one of my other apps; [Create Google App](https://github.com/lovkyndig/create-google-app){:target="_blank" .text-blue-500 .hover:text-blue-600 .transition-colors .duration-300}.

::::TabItem{name="Support?"}
If you are a new in this games, please ask me questions! Write a [question](https://github.com/lovkyndig/pwa-starter-app/discussions/categories/q-a){:target="_blank" .text-blue-500 .hover:text-blue-600 .transition-colors .duration-300}, or a comment below. Then I will get in touch as soon I get the message.
